# Multimodal-Processing-with-Cognition-Data
Repo for Master's Dissertation and working paper: "Multimodal Prompt-Tuning with Human Cognition Data" by Yingjia Wan.

The implementation code will be fully uploaded upon conference submission.

# Objective
The objectives description will be supplemented upon conference submission.



# Data
- The original ZuCo corpus is available at https://osf.io/uxamg/.

- This project also requires a `zuco_data_storage` folder inside the current dir, which is imported from https://github.com/DS3Lab/zuco-nlp/tree/master by Nora Hollenstein. I rename the folder name `zuco-nlp` to `zuco_data_storage`. Please refer to the [README.md](./zuco_data_storage/README.md) in the folder for acknowledgement details.
